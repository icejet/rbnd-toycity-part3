1.) I spent around 2 hours working on this project.
2.) The biggest challenge for me was changing the way I think about programming
to implement these object oriented concepts.  Doing that successfully has been
very rewarding.
3.) Both the features I built are based around the transaction class.
Feature 1: Search transactions by user name.
Feature 2: Search transactions by product title.
I built these features because I know from experience that searching by id isn't
usually practical since it is basically just an arbitrary number.
4.) I am still pretty new object oriented programming, and I have a ways to go
before I am ready to use it in production code. I'm also not used to having the
staggering number of methods and syntactic sugar at my disposal. It seems like
I could do a better job at making sure that there isn't an easier way to
accomplish whatever I'm trying to do.
